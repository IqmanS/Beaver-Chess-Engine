## OVERVIEW

It employs advanced algorithms like Min-Max Algorithm, NegaMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to provide an efficient and accurate gameplay. The engine's core functionality includes basic functions, such as analyzing the board state, generating possible moves as well as evaluating the strength of each move and selecting the best move. One of the key features of the engine is its use of piece positional tables to evaluate the strength of each move. These tables assign a numerical value to each piece based on its position on the board. By considering the position of each piece, the engine can make more strategic moves and react more effectively to the opponent's gameplay. This improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the engine's gameplay. These algorithms allow the engine to analyze board positions faster and more accurately, improving its overall gameplay.<br>
The project is currently under development and continuous improvement with the aim of optimizing the performance of the engine.</p>
